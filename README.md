Colons can be used to align columns.

| Cột 1        | Cột 2         | Cột 3     |
| ------------- |-------------| ---------|
| col 3 is      | ri1 | ok1 |
| col 2 is      | cered      |  ok2 |
| zebra cccc | are neat      |   ok3 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
